                    This is a code generator that creates
                    a <span class="color-theme">jetpack</span>,
                    a portable development environment for Java programmers.
                    <span class="color-theme">jetpacker</span> is inspired
                    by PuPHPet, Phansible, Rove, and Spring Initializr.

                    </h2>
                    A <span class="color-theme">jetpack</span> is a Java
                    development environment that is powered by Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker.
                    Armed with these tools, any Java developers can confidently:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Work on several projects that have different application architecture.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Share their projects with anyone without having to struggle with initial
                        installation and setup.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Keep their PCs organized and clean from most of the development tools.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                      So I need to know Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker?
                    </h2>
                    Not necessarily. All you need to do is follow the instructions from the documentation, generate
                    a <span class="color-theme">jetpack</span>, ignite it, and start coding.
                    However, having knowledge in these technologies will give you more options in customizations.
                    So it's always good to learn them.
