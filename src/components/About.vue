                <h3>What is <span class="color-theme">jetpackr</span></h3>
                <p>
                  This is a code generator that creates
                  a <span class="color-theme">jetpack</span>,
                  a portable development environment for Java programmers.
                  <span class="color-theme">jetpacker</span> is inspired
                  by PuPHPet, Phansible, Rove, and Spring Initializr.
                </p>

                <h3>What exactly is a <span class="color-theme">jetpack</span></h3>
                <p>
                  A <span class="color-theme">jetpack</span> is a development environment
                  that is powered by Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker. Armed with these tools,
                  any Java developers can confidently share their projects with anyone without
                  having to struggle with installation and setup.
                </p>

                <h3>Do I need to know Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker?</h3>
                <p>
                  No. All you need is to follow the instructions in the documentation, generate
                  a <span class="color-theme">jetpack</span>,
                  ignite it, and start coding. However, having knowledge in these technologies
                  will give you more options in customizations. So it's always good to learn them.
                </p>

                <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
                <p>
                  Programmers, hobbyists, teachers, students, etc can benefit from this project, regardless
                  of their experience levels.
